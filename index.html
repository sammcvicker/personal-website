        <p>Hello, I'm Sam, a designer, software developer, and experimental musician located in Southern Vermont. I recently received my BFA in Architectural Design from Bard College this year, focusing my research on the development of representational techniques better suited to emerging spatio-cognitive interpretations of classical Greco-Roman graffiti. I've been making websites for the last few years for my friends and their friends. If you would like a website, even if you aren't yet a friend or friend of friend, or, if you would like to reach me about anything else, send me an email (sammcvicker@protonmail.com) and I'll be in touch.</p>
